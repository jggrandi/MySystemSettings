--- Add to vhosts.conf
    Require all granted
--------------------------------
## Migrate from Acquia to Apache
--------------------------------
In Acquia, export drupal archive
Moving Drupal website to the server
- Database:
• (first time) access with root, add a mysql user and grant permissions
• mysql -u root -p
• GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; (it need to match with the drupal configs)
• \q (to quit)
• mysql -u username -p (enter with the created user)
• CREATE DATABASE dbname;
• USE dbname;

- Open a browser and visit the drupal site ( it will show the installation page)
- Follow the instructions using the DB user, pass and name from the previous step.
- Once you've gone through the setup process and your looking a fresh install of Drupal on your screen, go back to the terminal and recreate the database
• mysql -u username -p
• DROP DATABASE dbname;
• CREATE DATABASE dbname;
• USE dbname;
• \q
• mysql -u username -p databasename < database.sql 

- Make a backup of settings.php located in /var/www/<drupalsite>/sites/default/ (this file contains the settings for drupal to connect with the DB)
- copy the Drupal website folder to /var/www/ 
- change the ownership 
• chown -R www-data:www-data <drupalsite>
-copy the settings.php that was backuped back to /var/www/<drupalsite>/sites/default/

- Restart apache
• systemctl restart apache2

- Open the website in the browser (it should work)
- The template sometimes(?) can not load, but the main content will appear.
- Log with the admin account 
• sitename/user
- Solve the issues in the status report (in the admin panel, go to configuration and look for the link in the  red alert on top of the page)
• Not writable. The directory c:\windows\temp does not exist. Change to /tmp
- Clear all caches (in the admin panel, go to configuration->performance)

It should complete the migration.
